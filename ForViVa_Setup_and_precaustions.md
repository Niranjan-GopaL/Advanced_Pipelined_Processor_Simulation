# VS Code with 6 tabs
    -> main ( pipeline )
    -> main ( single_cycle )
    -> temp factorial
    -> temp sort
    -> bin_factorial
    -> bin_sort



# have temp files open 
    (Each assembly line code has inst number)

# draw the pipeline diagram for factorial BEFORE YOU GO
    -> you have it in the green book
    -> show ALL THE FORWARDINGS
    -> show how you are loading the pipeline reg


1. Execute FACTORIAL FIRST  in Single cycle ( WINDOWS TERMINAL )
    1. compare the temp file
    2. with the windows terminal output
    3. split screen and show everything
    4. compare with the pipeline diagram you drew

2. same thing for all else
